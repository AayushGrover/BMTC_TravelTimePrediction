pickle file:
its a way to stream objects in python

its a python specific tool to convert objects into a datastream and vice versa
this way, objects can be stored as code and retrieved later

these are python specific
they are designed for python so any restrictions that come up with json are not there

to use these files, first make a pickler or a depickler object
then you either dump(pickler) the data into the stream
or you load(depickler) the data from the stream
